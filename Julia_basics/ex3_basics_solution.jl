function mandel(x,y,max_iters)
    z = Complex(x,y)
    c = z
    threshold=2

        if abs(z)>threshold
            return n-1

    end

end
# If the value of mandel is less than max_iters, the point is provably outside the Mandelbrot set. 
# If mandel is equal to max_iters, then the point is provably inside the set. The larger max_iters, the better the quality of the estimate (the nicer will be your plot).

# Plot the value of function mandel for each pixel in a 2D grid of the box.
# (-1.7,0.7)*(-1.2,1.2)    
# Use a grid resolution of at least 1000 points in each direction and max_iters at least 10. 
# You can increase these values to get nicer plots. 
# To plot the values use function heatmap from the Julia package GLMakie. 
# Use LinRange to divide the horizontal and vertical axes into pixels. 
# See the documentation of these functions for help. GLMakie is a GPU-accelerated plotting back-end for Julia. 
# It is a large package and it can take some time to install and to generate the first plot. Be patient.
