Laplace Equation in Boundary Value Problems
The Laplace equation is one of the most important partial differential equations in scientific computing:
∇²u = 0
In 2D Cartesian coordinates, this becomes:
∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0
It describes steady-state phenomena like:

Electrostatic potential in charge-free regions
Steady-state temperature distribution with no heat sources
Gravitational potential in empty space
Pressure distribution in incompressible fluids

Discretization and Iterative Schemes
When we discretize the Laplace equation using finite differences on a grid, we get a linear system where each point's value is the average of its neighbors. For a 2D grid:
u(i,j) = (u(i+1,j) + u(i-1,j) + u(i,j+1) + u(i,j-1))/4
This naturally leads to iterative solution methods:
Jacobi Method (Revisited)
For the Laplace equation, the Jacobi method becomes:
u_new(i,j) = (u_old(i+1,j) + u_old(i-1,j) + u_old(i,j+1) + u_old(i,j-1))/4
We compute all new values using only old values, then update all points simultaneously.
Gauss-Seidel Method
An improvement over Jacobi is the Gauss-Seidel method:
u_new(i,j) = (u_new(i-1,j) + u_old(i+1,j) + u_new(i,j-1) + u_old(i,j+1))/4
Here, we immediately use new values as they become available, which typically accelerates convergence.
Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)
SOR further accelerates convergence by applying:
u_new(i,j) = (1-ω)u_old(i,j) + ω(u_new(i-1,j) + u_old(i+1,j) + u_new(i,j-1) + u_old(i,j+1))/4
Where ω is the relaxation parameter (1 < ω < 2 typically).
