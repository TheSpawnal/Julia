# In the parallel implementation of the Jacobi method, we assumed that the method runs for 
# a given number of iterations. In function, jacobi_with_tol at the beginning of the instructions 
# shows how the Jacobi iterations can be stopped when the difference between iterations is small. 
# Implement a parallel version of this function. 
# Start with the code in Exercise 1 and add the stopping criterion implemented in jacobi_with_tol.
